This is a program designed to send automated birthday messages on Groupme. It's built with React on the front end and runs on a NodeJS server on the backend with a MongoDB database.

I created this app for my own use in order to send custom birthday messages to everyone in a GroupMe group that I'm a part of. This is currently behind a rudimentary login with no ability to create an account so others can't send GroupMe messages to my groups, but I'm actively working integrating with a more robust, secure login system before making this live. I'm excited to share this with everyone to give them the opportunity to send birthday messages for their own groups!
